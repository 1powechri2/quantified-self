## Specific Endpoints

```
GET /api/v1/foods
```

The index will have the following format

```
[ {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Banana",
    "calories": 150
},
{
    "id": 2,
    "name": "chocolate",
    "calories": 50
} ]

```

```
GET /api/v1/foods/:id
```

Returns a specific food object with the specific :id passed in,
if the :id is invalid a 404 JSON is returned

```
POST /api/v1/foods
```

the new food needs to be posted in the parameters instead of the body of the post request
in this format

```
{ "food": { "name": "Name of food here", "calories": "Calories here"} }
```

If the food item is successfully created, the food item will be returned. If the food
item is not successfully created a 400 JSON is returned. Name and calories are required fields.

```
PATCH /api/v1/foods/:id
```

Updates an existing food item

just like post the new data needs to be sent by way of parameters in an identical
format like this

```
{ "food": { "name": "Mint", "calories": "14"} }
```

If food item is successfully updated it will be returned. If the food item
is not successfully updated, a 400 JSON will be returned.

```

if successful a 204 JSON is returned. If the food canâ€™t be found by :id a 404 JSON is returned.
